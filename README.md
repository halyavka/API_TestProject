# API_TestProject
1. This test project is based on testNg framework and uses maven as a builder.
2. For execution you should have installed on your machine: java jdk (version 8) and maven (version 3.5.*)

There are two ways how you can execute test:

1. Open terminal (if you use *nix machine) or command window (Windows os) and type commands:
$ cd /path_to_your_project/
$ mvn clean test

2. If you use IDE (for example Intellij Idea) you can import project and run TestSuite.java class as TestNg run_configuration.
